How to configure the global look and behavior of the "selectgclass" gadgets
===========================================================================

The default values for the most significant attributes defining the look
and feel of the gadgets can be globally set by the user in a preferences
file, called "ENV:Gadgets/select.prefs".

The attribute values found in the preferences file override the built-in
default values for the corresponding tags; if an attribute isn't present
in the file, or if the file is not found, it will keep using the value
most recently set (the initial one being the built-in default).

As the preferences file is just ASCII text, you can edit it by hand to
change the desired attributes. The format of the file is very simple; it
is a list of tool types (named exactly like the corresponding "selectgclass"
tags, minus the SGA_ prefix). See the class documentation for a detailed
explanation of the attributes and their possible values.

An example of file would be:

   ItemSpacing=3
   FullWidth=1
   PopUpDelay=250

As of now, the attributes settable by the user are the following ones ("inf"
means "infinite"):
